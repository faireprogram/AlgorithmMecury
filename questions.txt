4. Write a code to reverse a linked list. (NOT Java LinkedList API)
5. Write a code to merge two linked lists. (NOT Java LinkedList API)
6. Given an array of numbers and an integer k, rotate this array by k.
   For example: [1,2,3,4,5], k=2 --> [3,4,5,1,2] after rotation
7. You have an array of 100 numbers from 1 to 100, one number is missing, how do you find it?
8. You have an array of 1002 numbers from 1 to 1000, two numbers are redundant. How do you find them?
9. Given a binary tree, how to mirror it (swap left and right child)?
10. Write a code to find a certain substring from a string. (Implement indexOf method in String)
11. Given two array, find the common elements.
12. Reverse a string
13. Write a function to return whether a number if a power of 2. 
14. Find prime numbers from 1 to n.
15. There are random numbers from 1 to 10,000, find out the frequency of each number and which numbers are missing.
16. Find the minium and maximum path from a binary tree's root node to its leaves. 
17. Write a function to verify whether a given string is a number or not. 
18. How to verify whether a string is palindrome or not? (Use both recursive and non-recursive way)
    Note: All the cases should be considered. 
19. Given an array of numbers, each number has an duplicate except one number. Find this number.
    For example: [3, 4, 3, 5, 4] --> 5
20. Given two types of bricks with size 1 and size 2, find an algorithm to find the number of all possible 
    combinations of bricks to make a wall of size n.
21. Given an input string, say "abcd", find whether another string is a rotation of this string.
    For example: "bcda" is a rotation, "bacd" is not a rotation. 
22. How to find out whether a linked list has a cycle or not?
23. Write a function that returns Pascal's triangle for some depth n
    For example: depth = 3, the output is
    1 (0)
    1 1 (1)
    1 2 1 (2)
    1 3 3 1 (3)
24. Write a double linked list and write a demo to run it.
25. Sort a list of integers based on frequency, if same frequency, sort in natural order.
26. Implement a Queue by Stack
27. How to reverse an integer? (1234 --> 4321)
28. Given a string and a character, check whether this character is unique in the string.
29. Write function to check whether two input strings are permutation to each other.
    boolean isPermuation(String s1, String s2);
30. Find the smallest value in an ArrayList?
    Integer findMin(ArrayList<Integer> list);
31. Write a function to convert a String
    For example: "aaabbccddaaddcc" will be converted to "a5b2c4d4"
32. Given an integer array, starting from index 0, design an algorithm to compute how many moves 
    it needs to go out of the array. If it has a cycle or meets 0, then output -1.
    Example 1: input array is [2, -1, 1, 3, 2], output is 3 (2 -> 1 -> 3 -> out)
    Example 2: Input array is [2, -1, 0, 4], output is -1 (2 -> 0, dead)
    Example 3: Input array is [1, -1], output is -1 (1 -> -1 -> 1, a cycle)
33. Print a linked list in a reverse order.
34. Given a string, find out the length of the longest substring without duplicated characters.
